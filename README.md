## Introduction to Java.
Java programming language is a high-level  Object-oriented programming language(OOP) that was developed by James Gosling along with Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton, at **Sun Microsystems** in the early 1990's.

The java latest version is **Java SE 23**(as of Sept 2024)

* Oracle provides different editions of the Java platform, namely:
1. Java SE([Standard Edition](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/))
2. Java EE([Enterprise Edition](https://jakarta.ee/))

## Java Standard Edition
Java SE is the core version of Java that provides the basic functionality needed for developing general-purpose applications. It includes the essential libraries and tools for building desktop and standalone applications, including: Core libraries (eg, I/O, networking), Java Virtual Machine(JVM), Tools (such as javac and java debugger)
It is typically used for Desktop applications (including GUI-based programs), Command-line tools, small-scale applications, and Client-side applications.
## Java Enterprise Edition
* Java EE is a set of specifications built on top of Java SE, designed for building large-scale, multi-tiered, distributed enterprise applications.
* Java EE provides a rich set of APIs and tools for developers who need to create more complex, scalable, and secure systems such as Servlets, Java Persistence API, Java Message Service, and JavaMail.

It is typically used in Microservices, Distributed systems, and Enterprise applications.

Here are the general applications of the Java programming language
- Mobile applications
- Desktop applications
- Web applications
- Web servers and application servers
- Game development 
- Database connection
- Cloud-based applications

## Terminologies used in Java
- Java source code:
  This refers to the human-readable instructions written in the Java programming language, typically stored in files with a (.java extension.
- Java bytecode:
  This is the intermediate representation of Java source code that is generated by the Java compiler when you compile **.java**. This bytecode is stored in a **.class** file extension.
- Javac:
  This is the Java programming language compiler that is used to compile Java source code into bytecode.
- Java Development Kit(JDK)
  JDK is a complete software development kit that is used to develop Java applications. It includes the necessary components that are required for Java programming language such as Java Runtime Enviroment(JRE), 
  Development tools like javac and javadoc, libraries like **java.lang, java.util**.
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment):
The JRE is a subset of the JDK and is required to run Java applications.
It includes:- JVM (Java Virtual Machine), Core libraries (The essential Java class libraries, such as the java.lang and java.util packages, are included in the JRE).
In short, the JRE is for running Java applications. If you're only interested in running Java programs (not developing them), you only need the JRE.
