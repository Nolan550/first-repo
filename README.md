## Introduction in Java.
Java programming language is a high level  Object-oriented programming language(OOP) that was developed by James Gosling along with Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton, at **Sun Microsystems** in the early 1990's.

The java latest version is **Java SE 23**(as of Sept 2024)

* Oracle provides different editions of the Java platform namely:

2. Java EE([Enterprise Edition](https://jakarta.ee/))

## Java Standard Edition
Java SE is the core version of java used for providing the basic functionality needed for developing general-purpose applications. It includes the essential libraries and tools for building desktop and standalone applications,including: Core libraries (eg.I/O,networking),Java Virtual Machine(JVM), Tools (such as javac and java debugger)
It is typically used for Desktop applications (including GUI based programs), Command-line tools,Small scale applications,Client-side applications.
## Java Enterprise Edition
* Java EE is a set of specifications built on top of java SE, designed for building large-scale, multi-tiered, distributed enterprise applications.
* Java EE provides a rich sset of APIs and tools for developers who need to create more complex, scalable, and secure systems such as: Servlets, Java Persistence API, Java Message Service, JavaMail.

It is typically used in Microservices, Distributed systems,Enterprise applications.
